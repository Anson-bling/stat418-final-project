    <h2>About this App</h2>
    </center>

    <p>This app was developed based on the data about MLB teams and their game statistics during 1969-2018 seasons (collected on the baseball reference website at this <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/">link</a>). </p>
    
    <p>Using a linear regression model, it will output the estimated winning rate for a certain team in one baseball game based on user inputs.</p>
